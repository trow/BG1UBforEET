@0    = ~I ran into old Feldane, one of the monks who has lived at Candlekeep since before I can remember. He said that there are suspicious visitors staying at the keep, and that they are making use of the meeting rooms. He suspects that several of them are from the Iron Throne, while the remainder are from the Knights of the Shield. Apparently they're here to try to preserve the peace in the Sword Coast. In his opinion neither of these groups is entirely respectable, though they have done nothing wrong while here.~
@1    = ~You should be safe now.  Thank you for the advice.~
@2    = ~Gee, thanks.  I save you from being a permanent bird perch and all you can give me is a shred of advice and a bottle of murky liquid.  Leave before I turn you back to stone!~
@3    = ~Thank you for your advice, but I would prefer if you joined me in tracking down this beast.~
@4    = ~Mercenaries, huh.  Well I don't know what you're doing about these parts, but you'd better not have had any part in polluting this area.  Someone's really messed up nature's beauty, and eventually there's going to be hell to pay!~
@5    = ~Never met adventurers before.  Well if you're a bunch of heroes, maybe you could find out who's been dumping all their waste in the lakes 'round here.  You could find out who's at fault, and maybe put a stop to it, permanent-like.~
@6    = ~Sorry young'n, but I gotta lot of farming to do.~
